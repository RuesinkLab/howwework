# How we work

The Ruesink Lab has for decades explored ecological questions of how intertidal organisms structure their environment. Lab members have done PhD theses on aquaculture-environment interactions, morphology of seastars and gastropods, dynamics of eelgrass (Zostera marina), restoration of native oysters (Ostrea lurida), and functional redundancy of foundation species.
