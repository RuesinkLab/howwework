# How we work

The Ruesink Lab has for decades explored ecological questions of how intertidal organisms structure their environment. Lab members have done PhD theses on aquaculture-environment interactions, morphology of seastars and gastropods, dynamics of eelgrass (Zostera marina), restoration of native oysters (Ostrea lurida), and functional redundancy of foundation species. In soft-sediment coastal environments of Washington State, major ecosystem engineers are burrowing shrimp, which destabilize and turn over sediment, while eelgrass and oysters anchor sediment and serve as bioaccumulators.
